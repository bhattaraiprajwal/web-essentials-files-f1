Web development involves a combination of core technologies that work together to create functional, visually appealing, and responsive websites. HTML provides the structural foundation of each page, while CSS is used to design layouts, apply styles, and ensure the interface adapts across devices. JavaScript brings interactivity and dynamic behavior, allowing websites to respond to user actions in real time. Modern development also relies heavily on front-end frameworks, back-end languages, and databases, which help manage content, enhance performance, and support complex functionality. Together, these web technologies form the backbone of any successful website, ensuring it is fast, user-friendly, and capable of meeting modern digital standards.
